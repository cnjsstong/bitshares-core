* Author: Ryan R. Fox (`"fox"`)
* [国语翻译](mandarin_translation.md) Mandarin Translation: Tong Shen (`"tshen"`)

## 目的

* 为 BitShares Core 团队提供 **足够维持协议开发工作** 的资金
* 运营一支有利于 BitShares 去中心化自治社区（DAC）的跨领域 **协作团队**
* 让社区、监管者和公众参与进来，成为协议开发方向的 **决定性来源**，并透明地获得相关信息

## 背景


本预算提案基于[2018年BitShares核心团队](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2018-03-bitshares-core)所做的工作。目的是为了继续支持核心协议的开发，并且能够帮助去中心化自治社区的经营以期在2019年能够作出更多成就。核心团队有责任为去中心化自治社区透明交付安全的协议，并且在研究上协作，将创新放在第一位并且致力于帮助社区和公众了解和使用协议。

## 工作

这份预算提案在2019年为以下工作提供资金：
* BitShares核心开发
* 协作工具
* 会议费用与社区经营


这些资金只会用于改善BitShares项目所需要的创意，协作，开发等工作以及保护相关创意，参与和实现的工作上。受到该预算资金支持的个人将以表2中工资率实行一系列的特定职能核心团队角色。


BTS 将会被收集到`"workers.bitshares.foundation"`的多签名账户中，该账户由`"BitShares Blockchain Foundation"`控制，由`"BitShares Blockchain Foundation"`拥有并使用预算工作模型  [1]，该模型拥有以下的特征：
* 由BitShares区块链基金 [2] 提供透明的会计工作 
* 五个工作日内完成的单据检查，批准, 汇款
* 使用一种可靠的智能货币进行赔偿汇款（比如bitCNY）
* 在工作人员结算后将所有累积未分配的BTS代币归还到储备池

因为团队的规模增大或者BTS代币的价值波动，将会分配更多的工作人员来完成该任务。





## Core 团队工作领域


核心团队仍然专注于[核心协议](https://github.com/bitshares.com/bitshares-core)的维护和开发以及对[BitShares改进提案（BSIP)](https://github.com/bitshares.com/bsips)流程的监督。核心团队将继续与[BitShares UI团队](https://github.com/bitshares.com/bitshares-ui)保持联系，并在GitHub上的[BitShares组织](https://github.com/bitshares)内维护其他社区领导工作。核心团队继续通过下面详述的社区声明计划指导社区贡献者晋升为开放核心团队角色。


协作工具包括软件工具和支持开发和测试的服务器基础架构
[bitshares-core](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core)
GitHub库仍然是我们主要的规划，讨论和交付的来源。核心团队与UI团队和BitShares委员会协作管理[GitHub上的BitShares组织](https://github.com/bitshares)的访问权限。



无论是参加国际会议还是在相关国际会议上发表讲话，或是编程马拉松赛等各种活动仍然是核心团队向外发展社区的重要事项。我们将在国际会议之前进行当面会议，并且全年举行远程规划会议。

扩展后的核心团队2019年的计划将包括：
* 参加一个额外的国际会议

## BitShares Core 团队成员、角色和预算


核心团队由一群社区成员组成，这些成员在2018年已经证明了他们能够很好的以去中心化的组织形式进行协作，从社区成员中招募高贡献人群，并且加速项目创新的步伐。每一个组织成员都致力于回报BitShares去中心化自治社区，而不是想要从储备池中获利。



This Worker proposes to **budget $26,750 weekly** for funding development efforts of the Core Team 
and Community Claims. Approximately $21,450 are consumed by the established Core Team members, 
leaving $5,300 available for Community Claims or 20% Core Team growth. Demonstrated results of these 
efforts may warrant drafting subsequent Proposals to fund growth beyond this budget. Weekly quality 
effort hours estimations are represented in _Table 1_ below. 

此Worker提议**每周预算$ 26,750 **用于资助核心团队的开发工作和社区需求。已建立的核心团队将消耗大约21,450美元，
留下5,300美元用于社区需求或20％核心团队增长预算。工作量证明的结果可能需要起草后续提案才能为超出预算的资金需求提供资金。每周预估的工作时长在_Table 1_中表示。

## BitShares Core 团队

The BitShares Core Team is a self-organizing agile-principled team focused on delivering regularly
scheduled releases and ad hoc bug fixes for the BitShares Core software. The actual number of
contributors and roles **may vary** within each development cycle (described below), leading to
variations in weekly compensation per contributor. The Core Team has discretion in allocating 
resources to meet the needs of each development cycle. 

Producing reliable and secure software at scale requires ideation, organization, definition,
prioritization, development, testing and documentation. The ideal team composition includes roles
specializing in each of these functions and capable of contributing to many. The goal of a highly
functioning team is to fully utilize each individual's effort and together maximize their
collective output. 

The Core Team records only "quality effort hours" for the role they are tracking time against. 
Self-reporting is used, tracked within collaboration tools and peer-checked by Team Members to ensure
the effort matches expected quality for the period. 

## 开发周期*

  * 功能发布 (不影响共识机制):
    * 5 周冲刺周期
  * 协议升级 (影响共识机制):
    * 每年 2 次，至少 6 个月协议稳定期

_* Core 团队成员达成一致可更改时间_

A typical Feature Release will likely span three weeks from planning thru tested and delivered
software, called a sprint. Many agile principals will be adopted by the Core Team, but do not
expect a strict scrum practice. This is a global team, so a formal daily standup is unlikely. One
should expect asynchronous communication within various collaboration tools keeping the team
informed of progress, plans and problems. The community are our stakeholders; we look to them for
ideas, enhancements and identifying bugs, then organize these into a backlog for future
development. The Coordinator facilitates the prioritization of the backlog items based on feedback
from the stakeholders and the Core Team. The team will keep the stakeholders informed of
development progress throughout the sprint.

At the beginning of a sprint cycle the Core Team meets to review the prioritized backlog and
identify the highest value items that each can contribute to, within the established time block.
Many features have dependencies and cannot be implemented within a single sprint. Therefore, the
team will create tasks, a subset of the feature, that can be delivered on time. A task may be
researching and defining requirements to be implemented later. A task may be writing a test case,
or perhaps implementing only a subset of a given requirement, or even documenting how existing code
functions. The team will maintain a sprint backlog comprised of the tasks selected from the project 
backlog. Completing each of these tasks results in incremental value added to the project. Testing 
is performed throughout the sprint to ensure functioning code from each increment. 

As the sprint nears completion, the Core Team will begin release planning. They will select which
tested increments are ready to be included in a release candidate. This will be deployed to a
staging network for final validation. A release will be tagged within the bitshares-core GitHub
repo along with release notes. The team also produce stakeholder documentation detailing resource
allocations and budget consumption.

The final steps of the sprint include a retrospective look at how the team performed. Here we
reflect on our original estimates, the delivered increments and what contributed to our successes
and shortcomings. We will use insights gained from the retrospective to improve in the next sprint.
The following day we immediately begin our next sprint cycle.

## 社区认领计划

The BitShares Core Team maintain a prioritized 
[Project Backlog](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/projects/6:) of ideas, enhancements, 
bugs and BSIPs which they select from for their development sprint. The community is encouraged to 
comment on the items to aid in refining requirements and guide prioritization. Effort estimates are 
first assigned to the highest value backlog items. Unassigned **and estimated** project backlog items
are available for ad hoc _bounty_ development. Claiming and successfully completing backlog items is 
a primary consideration for an invitation to join the Core Team on a future sprint.

The Core Team encourages ad hoc code contributions of estimated project backlog items from any
community member and will compensate successfully merged code based on estimates approved by Core
Developers. The Coordinator will facilitate onboarding new community contributors to _claim_ a 
backlog item and implement a solution that fits within architecture design defined by the Core Team. 
Care must be taken to ensure effort is not duplicated and can easily be merged within a future 
sprint. Claimed items that become a dependency of a sprint may be recalled by the Core Team to
facilitate feature delivery. Compensation for a partially completed increment will be evaluated by 
the Q/A Lead and Coordinator.

Funding for Community Claims comes from unallocated budget within the _Core Team Effort Budget_ 
resulting from open Roles on the Core Team as detailed in _Table 1_.

## 开发倡议

The Team has identified in _Chart 1_ a set of Initiatives to research, define and develop as part of 
their 2019 Roadmap. 

**Caveat**: The Core Team cannot commit to deliver fully implemented solutions for all identified
Initiatives. The intent here is to provide guidance at the outset, realizing the Core Team
continuously evaluates and prioritizes new development tasks ongoing.

## 工作预算

The budget items listed in the tables below represent an **upper bound** on expenditures. All funds
collected and unused at the conclusion of this Worker Proposal will be returned to the Reserve
Pool [5-6].

**Table 8. Core Team Budget**

## 期限与支付方式

**Duration:**
This proposal will last for 47 weeks, starting from 4th February 2019, ending on 29th December 2019.

**Transparent Accounting:**
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work
performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous period
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted time sheets, then forward invoices to BitShares
Blockchain Foundation for release of funds from escrow to contributor's account
* Coordinator will review and approve vendor invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain
Foundation for direct payment to vendor

**Devaluation Multiplier:**
This Worker introduces a _devaluation multiplier_ to mitigate the impacts of a depreciating BTS token 
during the active period. We propose to protect against prolonged BTS devaluation of approximately 
one-third (-33%) by using a 1.50 _devaluation multiplier_. Initially, BTS will be accumulated at rate
150% of the required daily budget. The BBF will use the accumulated BTS to purchase bitCNY from the 
market, up to the _Core Team Budget_ detailed above in _Table 8_. 

**Calculations (as of 27 JAN 2019):**
* 6.75 = USD/CNY foreign exchange rate
* 3.93824 = bitCNY/BTS price feed 
* 1.50 = Devaluation multiplier to mitigate market fluctuations
* **168,032 BTS/day** ≈ $4,214 USD/day * 6.75 USD/CNY * 3.93824 bitCNY/BTS * 1.50 devaluation multiplier 

**Payments:**
All payments are converted from USD and remitted in bitCNY with method developed by the BitShares 
Blockchain Foundation [1].
