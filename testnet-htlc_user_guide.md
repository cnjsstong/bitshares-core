TESTNET: User Guide for Hashed Time-Lock Contracts (HTLC) on BitShares
=====================================================================

**Note:** __This documentation applies to the BitShares **Public TESTNET only**. HTLC is not yet__
__implemented on MAINNET.__

**Note:** __The BitShares HTLC implementation is **beta software** and should be used for__ 
__experimentation purposes only. The software may not perform as designed and you may lose value__
__as a result.__

**Note:** __The BitShares UI Web Wallet does not yet implement the HTLC features. Therefore, one__
__must use the BitShares CLI (command line wallet) to interact with HTLC directly. The UI Team is__
__working with the Core Team to implement the required graphical interface prior to mainnet release.__

## Introduction

An HTLC is a __conditional transfer__ of value from "depositor" to "recipient" where two distinct
encumbrances prevent immediate execution. 1) The __hashlock__ requires presenting the proper "preimage"
to the blockchain prior to the 2) __timelock__ expiration, else the value automatically returns to
"depositor".

This allows two parties to exchange tokens on independent platforms trustlessly and securely and thus
enables Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps (ACCS) among other useful functionalities.

Getting Started with HTLC
=========================
There are 5 steps to progress through when working with an HTLC:
1. Generate a "preimage" (depositor)
1. Calculate the "preimage_hash" (depositor)
1. Create the HTLC (depositor)
1. Verify the HTLC (recipient)
1. Redeem the HTLC (recipient)

## 0. Prerequisites 
1. The "depositor" must have an unlocked `cli_wallet` with their account (e.g `alice`) 
 - a. `alice` must have a balance of TEST tokens in her wallet
 - b. anyone may issue this command to verify: $>`list_account_balances alice` 
2. The "recipient" must have an unlocked `cli_wallet` with their account (e.g `bob`)
 - a. `bob` may have a 0 balance

**Note**: __For testing purpose, the accounts may be in the same wallet__

## 1. Generate a "preimage" (depositor)

1. `alice` must generate a "preimage" (think: password) and keep is safe from `bob` until she is 
ready to reveal it him. 
2. Using this [external website](https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/) generate a
"preimage"
3. Enter your "preimage" text into the textbox
4. Count how many characters your entered, including spaces, this is your "preimage_length" in bytes
5. Retain your "preimage" and "preimage_length" for later use
6. Example: "preimage" is `My Preimage` and "preimage_length" is `11` bytes

## 2. Calculate the "preimage_hash" (depositor)

1. `alice` must calculate the "preimage_hash" from the __preimage__ she generated above
2. Just below the textbox will be the SHA256 hash of your __preimage__ string
3. Retain this as your "preimage_hash" for later use
4. Example: "preimage_hash" is `650BFCEF53BD8E6E030613E0B75EC0CBA4FCD25C53BF0D15A6283593B269DF79`

## 3. Create the HTLC (depositor)
1. `alice` will create the HTLC using the `htlc_create` command with syntax of `htlc_create <from> <to> <amount> <symbol> <hash_algo> <preimage_hash> <preimage_length> <expiration> <broadcast>`
 - a. <from> is `alice` our depositor
 - b. <to> is `bob` our recipient
 - c. <amount> is the number of tokens to be locked into the contract (e.g. `100`)
 - d. <symbol> is the token symbol (e.g. `TEST`)
 - e. <hash_algo> will be `SHA256` (future releases may support additional hash algorithms)
 - f. <preimage_hash> is the calculated value from #2 (**not the preimage** which remains private)
 - g. <preimage_length> is the number of bytes from #1
 - h. <expiration> is the __timelock__ expressed as the number of seconds the HTLC will remain valid
  upon broadcast to the blockchain (e.g. `300` for 5 minutes)
 - i. <broadcast> is a boolean value which must be set to `true` to be sent by the `cli_wallet` software
2. `alice` will execute this command: $(unlocked)>`htlc_create alice bob 100 TEST SHA256 "650BFCEF53BD8E6E030613E0B75EC0CBA4FCD25C53BF0D15A6283593B269DF79" 11 300 true`
3. The HTLC is now active and the __hashlock__ expiration is counting down the seconds for bob to verify
and redeem.
4. The 100 TEST tokens are deducted from the account balance of `alice` and are locked into the HTLC, 
protected by both the __hashlock__ and __timelock__ encumbrances.

## 4. Verify the HTLC (recipient)

1. `bob` must validate the HTLC created by `alice` meets his requirements. He can do this by looking 
at the recent __account history operations__ for her account to find the active HTLC.
2. `bob` will execute this command: $(unlocked)>`get_account_history alice 1`
 - a. This will return the most recent operation, which should begin with "HTLC Create to bob" 
 - b. Locate the HTLC "database_id" having the format `1.18.XX` 
   - i. "XX" will also be a numeric value unique to the HTLC `alice` created
   - ii. Retain the complete HTLC "database_id" (e.g `1.18.99`)
3. `bob` will use the "database_id" to execute this command: $(unlocked)>`get_htlc 1.18.99`
4. `bob` will verify the following values meet his expectations, as agreed to previously with `alice`:
 - a. from
 - b. to
 - c. amount
 - d. symbol
 - e. expiration
5. `bob` will now learn about the __hashlock__ `alice` applied in these fields:
 - a. hash_algo
 - b. preimage_hash
 - c. preimage_length
6. If `bob` validates everything, he may proceed to Redeem the HTLC
7. Else, `alice` will automatically receive the value locked in the HTLC when the __timelock__ expires 

## 5. Redeem the HTLC (recipient)

1. `bob` will obtain the `preimage` from `alice`, likely after performing the agreed upon task
2. The `htlc_redeem` command has the following syntax: `htlc_redeem <htlc_database_id> <preimage> <fee_paying_account> <broadcast>`
3. `bob` will execute the following command: $(unlocked)>`htlc_redeem 1.18.99 "My Preimage" bob true`
4. The "preimage" `bob` supplied satisfies the __hashlock__ encumbrance on the HTLC and the `100 TEST`
are moved into his account balance (less 1 TEST which is paid as the transaction fee).
5. anyone may issue this command to verify: $>`list_account_balances bob`

Using Two HTLCs to Perform an Atomic Swap
=========================================

An __atomic swap__ involves a pair of HTLCs related by the same __hashlock__ within both, allowing for 
trustless exchange of distinct tokens between distinct accounts. More on how to perform this on the
TESTNET shortly.

Performing an Atomic Cross Chain Swap (ACCS)
============================================

The ultimate goal for our HTLC implementation is to allow the trustless exchange of tokens on the 
BitShares blockchain for tokens on a foreign blockchain. We will likely start with TESTBTC instructions
in the coming weeks. Please practice on our chain first.
